Lesson Content System for Learno Educational Backend
=============================================================================
COMPREHENSIVE VERSION - Full Chapter Coverage with Dynamic Teaching

Philosophy:
- Each chapter is divided into CONCEPTS (not just questions)
- Each concept has: Explanation → Examples → Practice → Verification
- AI teaches like a real teacher: explain first, then test
- Lesson doesn't end until ALL concepts are mastered
- Adaptive: more practice if struggling, faster if doing well

Structure:

Now that you know the numbers, let's USE them! 🎉

Counting means finding out HOW MANY things there are! 🔢

We count things every day:
🍎 How many apples?
⭐ How many stars?
👆 How many fingers?

Let me teach you the MAGIC of counting! ✨

Here's the SECRET to counting correctly! 🤫✨

The Counting Rules:
1️⃣ Point to EACH thing ONE time
2️⃣ Say ONE number for EACH thing
3️⃣ The LAST number you say is HOW MANY!

Let me show you:

If I have apples: 🍎 🍎 🍎

I point and count:
👆🍎 "One!"
👆🍎 "Two!"
👆🍎 "Three!"

The last number was THREE! So there are 3 apples! 🎉

Important! Don't skip any, and don't count the same one twice! 😊

You're so good at counting now! 🎉

Now let's learn something fun: COMPARING! 🔍

Comparing means looking at two groups and asking:
❓ Which has MORE?
❓ Which has LESS?

This helps us know which group is BIGGER! 🌟

Here's how to compare two groups! 🔢

Step 1: Count the FIRST group
Step 2: Count the SECOND group  
Step 3: Which NUMBER is bigger?

The group with the BIGGER number has MORE! 📈
The group with the SMALLER number has LESS! 📉

Example:
🍎🍎🍎 (3 apples) vs 🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌 (5 bananas)

3 apples... 5 bananas...
5 is BIGGER than 3!

So bananas has MORE! ✅
And apples has LESS! ✅

Easy rule: More things = bigger number! 🌟

Imagine you have 2 apples: 🍎🍎

Now put them TOGETHER:

Count all of them: 1, 2, 3!

So: 2 + 1 = 3! ✨

The + sign means "put together" or "add"!
